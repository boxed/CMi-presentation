CMI Plugin: Presentation
==========================

This is the CMi plugin I used to present CMi in my talk at the Django meetup in Stockholm 2013-10-14. To use it in CMi
put this code into a folder called "presentation" in ~/Library/Application Support/CMi/plugins like this:

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/CMi/
mkdir plugins
cd plugins
git clone git@github.com:boxed/CMI-presentation.git presentation
````
